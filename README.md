# Simple Chat Application Using Java Socket Programming

A simple **console-based chat application** built using **Java Socket Programming** that allows communication between a server and a client in real time.  
This project demonstrates basic networking concepts such as TCP sockets and client-server communication.

## 🚀 Features

✔ Bi-directional messaging between client and server  
✔ Real-time text chat in console/terminal  
✔ Uses Java `Socket` and `ServerSocket` for TCP communication  
✔ Easy to run and understand — great for learning Java networking principles :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **server** starts and listens on a specific port.  
2. The **client** connects to the server using the server's IP and port.  
3. Once connected, both sides can send and receive messages in real time using TCP sockets.  
Internally, Java’s `Socket` and I/O streams handle the data transfer. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
